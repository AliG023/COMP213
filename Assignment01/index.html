                I also love riding my onewheel. For those of you that have never heard of onewheel. They are an awesome eletric skateboard. I use it to take the dog for a run or for taking my son out when he wants to ride his bike. It's also great for off-road trails or popping to the shops.

                I love to travel and have visited 42 different countries. One of the reasons I enjoy travelling is to experience the food and cultures that different countries have to offer.
